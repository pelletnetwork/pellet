# Dashboard Terminal Integration

Replace the chat interface with an embedded terminal emulator. The terminal is the primary interaction surface — users type agent CLIs (claude, codex, etc.) directly in the dashboard.

## Layout Changes

### Main Column (left, flex: 2.2)
- **Was:** 7-day signed payments table
- **Now:** Embedded terminal (xterm.js)
- Terminal fills the card container, minimal "TERMINAL" uppercase label header matching existing card style
- No window chrome (no traffic lights) — card border/shadow defines boundary

### Right Rail (flex: 1)
Card order top to bottom:
1. Agent Identity card (unchanged)
2. Signed Payments card (moved from main column) — compact, scrollable, fixed height, shows full transaction list with internal scroll. "View all" link to transactions page
3. Session Keys card (unchanged)
4. Pending Authorizations card (unchanged)

### Mobile (<600px)
Single column: terminal on top (~50vh fixed height), rail cards below in scrollable area.

### Navigation
- Remove "Chat" from nav bar
- Add "Txs" in its place, linking to full transactions page
- Full chat page (`/wallet/chat`, `/oli/wallet/chat`) remains accessible but is no longer in primary nav

## Terminal Component

### TerminalCard.tsx
React client component wrapping xterm.js.

**Dependencies:**
- `@xterm/xterm` — terminal emulator
- `@xterm/addon-fit` — auto-resize to container
- `@xterm/addon-webgl` — GPU-accelerated rendering

**Theming:**
- Follows dashboard theme (light/dark)
- Reads CSS custom properties: `--bg`, `--fg`, and derived colors
- Light mode: white background, dark text
- Dark mode: dark background, light text
- Font: Commit Mono (matches dashboard), falls back to ui-monospace

**Behavior:**
- On mount, attempts websocket connection to `ws://localhost:7778/terminal`
- Connected state: live interactive terminal, user can type freely
- Disconnected state: shows connection instructions inside the terminal area (monospace styled, not a modal)
- Auto-reconnects on disconnect with backoff
- Fits to container on resize (addon-fit)

### Connection Instructions (disconnected state)
Rendered inside the terminal card area in monospace, not a separate UI:
```
  pellet terminal

  start your local bridge to connect:

    npx pellet-terminal

  or add to your dev script:

    "dev": "next dev & npx pellet-terminal"
```

### First-Run Onboarding (connected, no agent yet)
When the terminal bridge connects and no agent has been paired to this wallet, the shell session starts with a guided welcome instead of a bare prompt. This runs as a shell script (`.pellet/welcome.sh`) that the bridge executes on first connection:

```
  pellet

  which agent? (type name)
  > claude

  found claude at ~/.claude/settings.json
  add pellet wallet to claude's MCP servers? (y/n)
  > y

  done. launching claude...
```

Simple ASCII wordmark at the top, then a guided flow:
1. User types agent name (claude, codex, etc.)
2. Script detects the agent's config file (e.g. `~/.claude/settings.json` for Claude)
3. Asks permission to add Pellet MCP server to the agent's config
4. Writes the MCP entry, then launches the agent

The agent starts with wallet context via MCP — pairing completes as a side effect of usage. No tokens, no separate page. Three keystrokes.

For unrecognized agents, falls back to showing the MCP config snippet to paste manually.

After the first agent connection, subsequent terminal sessions drop straight to a normal shell prompt. The onboarding only runs once (tracked via a `.pellet/.onboarded` flag file).

## Backend: Local WebSocket Bridge

### pellet-terminal binary
Lightweight local-only websocket server. Ships as an npx-runnable package or script in the repo.

**What it does:**
1. Starts websocket server on `localhost:7778`
2. On connection, spawns user's shell (`$SHELL` or `/bin/zsh`)
3. Pipes stdin/stdout/stderr between websocket and shell process
4. Sets wallet-aware environment variables (`PELLET_WALLET_ADDRESS`, `PELLET_SESSION_KEY`, etc.) so agents have wallet context
5. Single connection at a time (rejects additional connections)

**Security:**
- Binds to `localhost` only — not accessible from network
- No authentication needed (local machine trust model)
- Shell runs as the current user with their normal permissions

**Implementation:**
- Node.js script using `ws` library + `node-pty` for PTY allocation
- PTY required for proper terminal behavior (colors, cursor movement, ctrl-c, etc.)
- Can be a script at `scripts/terminal-bridge.js` initially, extracted to a package later

## Components Removed

- `ChatRailCard.tsx` — replaced by TerminalCard
- `ChatDrawer.tsx` — replaced by TerminalCard on mobile too
- Chat rail card CSS (in specimen-wallet.css)
- Chat drawer CSS (in ChatDrawer.tsx inline styles)

**Not removed:**
- Chat SSE endpoints (`/api/wallet/chat/stream`, `/api/wallet/chat/reply`) — agents still use these
- Full chat page component (`SpecimenWalletChat.tsx`) — remains accessible, just not in primary nav
- Chat message database tables — still needed for agent communication

## Components Modified

- `SpecimenWalletDashboard.tsx` — swap ChatRailCard for TerminalCard in main column, move signed payments to rail
- `Dashboard.tsx` — same layout swap
- `WalletTabs.tsx` or nav component — "Chat" → "Txs"
- `specimen-wallet.css` — update column content styles, add terminal card styles
- `specimen-wallet-pages.css` — add transactions full page styles if needed

## New Files

- `app/wallet/dashboard/TerminalCard.tsx` — xterm.js wrapper component
- `scripts/terminal-bridge.js` — local websocket PTY server
- `app/oli/wallet/dashboard/txs/page.tsx` — full transactions page (does not exist yet)
- `app/wallet/dashboard/txs/page.tsx` — canonical route equivalent

## Port Convention

WebSocket bridge runs on `localhost:7778`. Chosen to avoid conflicts with common dev ports (3000, 3001, 5173, 8080). Configurable via `PELLET_TERMINAL_PORT` env var.
